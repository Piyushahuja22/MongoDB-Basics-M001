Q.  When connecting to an Atlas cluster using the shell, why do we provide the hostnames for all nodes when we launch mongo? Choose the best answer from the choices below.
Choose the best answer:

--So that if the primary node goes down, the shell can connect to other nodes in the cluster instead
--There really isn't a good reason
--To make it possible for all the nodes to communicate with each other
--Because our authentication credentials are not stored on the primary, but on other nodes in our cluster.
--So that other nodes in the cluster can contact our client, if necessary
